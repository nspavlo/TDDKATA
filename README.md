# Fizz Buzz Kata

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

# Prime Factors Kata

> Write a class named “PrimeFactors” that has one static method: generate.
The generate method takes an integer argument and returns a List<Integer>.  That list contains the prime factors in numerical sequence.

# The Greeting Kata

### Requirement 1

> Write a method greet(name) that interpolates name in a simple greeting. For example, when name is "Bob", the method should return a string "Hello, Bob."

### Requirement 2

> Handle nulls by introducing a stand-in. For example, when name is null, then the method should return the string "Hello, my friend."

### Requirement 3

> Handle shouting. When name is all uppercase, then the method should shout back to the user. For example, when name is "JERRY" then the method should return the string "HELLO JERRY!"

### Requirement 4

> Handle two names of input. When name is an array of two names (or, in languages that support it, varargs or a splat), then both names should be printed. For example, when name is ["Jill", "Jane"], then the method should return the string "Hello, Jill and Jane."
